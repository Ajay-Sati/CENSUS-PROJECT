# CENSUS-PROJECT
The Customer Classification Model is designed to categorize individuals based on a variety of factors such as workclass, education, marital status, and more, ultimately classifying them into two income brackets: less than or equal to 50K and more than 50K. The project encompasses a comprehensive workflow that includes data visualization, data preprocessing, data selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a final assessment of model performance using various metrics.

The initial stages of the project involve data visualization, allowing for a clear and intuitive understanding of the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, thorough data preprocessing is performed to ensure the quality and relevance of the input data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

The data selection process involves identifying and retaining the most influential features for model training. Once the data is prepared, various machine learning models are trained to classify customers into the specified income categories. The model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize performance and enhance predictive accuracy.

Finally, the goodness of the model is assessed using a range of metrics such as  precision, recall, and F1 score.. This thorough evaluation ensures that the model's performance aligns with the project's objectives and provides meaningful insights into the classification of customers based on income levels.
